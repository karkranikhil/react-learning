## Yarn
Yarn is a Dependency manager and its really fast because yarn do package installation tasks in parallel.
Every time a module is added, Yarn creates (or updates) a yarn.lock file. This way you can guarantee another machine installs the exact same package, while still having a range of allowed versions defined in package.json.
Yarn does some better caching

## If you haven't installed yarn, install it via

  npm intall --global yarn
