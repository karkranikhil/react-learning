# React learning

## Yarn
1)Yarn is a Dependency manager and its really fast because yarn do package installation tasks in parallel.<br/>
2)Every time a module is added, Yarn creates (or updates) a yarn.lock file. This way you can guarantee another machine installs the exact same package, while still having a range of allowed versions defined in package.json.<br/>
3)Yarn does some better caching<br/>

## If you haven't installed yarn, install it via

  npm intall --global yarn
